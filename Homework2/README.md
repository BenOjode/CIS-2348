ZyLab 6.17 Password Modifier - 
Takes a simple password and makes it stronger by replacing characters using the key below, and by appending "q*s" to the end of the     input string.
  i becomes !
  a becomes @
  m becomes M
  B becomes 8
  o becomes .

ZyLab 6.22 Brute force Equation Solver  - 
Given integer coefficients of two linear equations with variables x and y, use brute force to find an integer solution for x and y in the range -10 to 10.

Zylab 7.25 Exact Change - Functions 
Create a function that has the total change amount as an integer input that outputs the change using the fewest coins, one coin type per line. The coin types are dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Use singular and plural coin names as appropriate, like 1 penny vs. 2 pennies.

ZyLab 8.10 Palindrome  - 
A palindrome is a word or a phrase that is the same when read both forward and backward. Examples are: "bob," "sees," or "never odd or even" (ignoring spaces). Write a program whose input is a word or phrase, and that outputs whether the input is a palindrome.

ZyLab 9.10 Word Frequencies (Lists)  - 
Read in the name of an input file and then reads the file using the csv.reader() method. The file contains a list of words separated by commas. Your program should output the words and their frequencies (the number of times each word appears in the file) without any duplicates.

Coding Problem 2 - 
Write a basic program that performs simple file and mathematical
operations.
a.
Write a program that reads dates from input, one date per line. Each
date's format must be as follows: March 1, 1990. Any date not following
that format is incorrect and should be ignored. Use the find() method to
parse the string and extract the date. The input ends with -1 on a line
alone. Use the datetime module to get the current date. Ignore any dates
that are later than the current date. Output each correct date as:
3/1/1990.
b.
After the program is working as above, modify the program so that it
reads all dates from an input file “inputDates.txt” (an Example file is
attached).
c.
Modify your program further so that after parsing all dates from the
input file “inputDates.txt”, it writes out the correct ones into an
output file called: “parsedDates.txt”.
